About Student Management System Project in Python
In the Student Management system Project in python, we will see a project that manages all the information of the students 
It includes managing data such as name, email-id, contact number, date of birth, which stream they are in, etc.
In this tutorial of the Python project, we will build a GUI-based Student Management System Project using the Tkinter, 
SQLite3, tkcalendar, messagebox, and datetime and Ttk modules of the Tkinter library. It is an intermediate-level project, 
where you will learn how to use databases, and modules and make some great GUIs in Python and apply them in real life.

The basic task to be performed on this Project are:

1. Add all the details

2. View the details

3. Reset the details

4. Delete the details

5. Delete the entire database of the student’s record

modules are used for the following purposes:

1. Tkinter – To create the GUI.
2. SQLite3 – To connect the program to the database and store information in it.
3. TkCalender – To get the user to enter a date.
4. Datetime.date – To convert the date from the tree to a Datetime.date instance so that it can be set in.
5. Tkinter.messagebox – To show a display box, displaying some information or an error.
6. Tkinter.ttk – To create the tree where all the information will be displayed.
